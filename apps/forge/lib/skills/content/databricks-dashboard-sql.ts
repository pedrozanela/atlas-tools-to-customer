const DATASET_RULES = `Dashboard Dataset SQL Rules (Lakeview):
- Each dataset is a SINGLE SELECT statement (no semicolons, no multiple queries)
- Always use fully-qualified table names: catalog.schema.table_name
- KPI dataset: must return exactly 1 row (pre-aggregated summary)
- Trend dataset: must include a DATE or TIMESTAMP column for time series
- Breakdown dataset: GROUP BY dimension + ORDER BY metric DESC + LIMIT 10 for top-N
- Spark SQL syntax ONLY: use date_sub(current_date(), N) not INTERVAL, DATE_TRUNC not EXTRACT
- Safe date parsing: try_to_date(col, 'yyyy-MM-dd') with COALESCE chain -- NEVER TO_DATE
- Put ALL business logic (CASE/WHEN, COALESCE, ratios) into the dataset SQL with explicit AS aliases
- Every widget fieldName must exactly match a dataset column or alias -- the contract is strict`;

const WIDGET_RULES = `Dashboard Widget Rules (CRITICAL for valid rendering):
- Widget field name in query.fields MUST exactly match fieldName in encodings (e.g. both "sum(spend)")
- Aggregation pattern: {"name": "sum(revenue)", "expression": "SUM(\`revenue\`)"} in query.fields; {"fieldName": "sum(revenue)"} in encodings
- Counter widgets: version=2, use disaggregated=true for 1-row datasets, disaggregated=false with aggregation when filters apply
- Table widgets: version=2, columns only need fieldName and displayName (no type/format properties)
- Chart widgets (bar/line/pie): version=3
- Text widgets: NO spec block at all -- use multilineTextboxSpec directly on widget object; SEPARATE widgets for title and subtitle (multiple lines array items concatenate, not stack)
- Filter widgets: use filter-multi-select, filter-single-select, or filter-date-range-picker -- NEVER "filter" (invalid)
- Filter widgets: version=2, disaggregated=false, queryName in encodings must match query name exactly
- Filter widgets: always include frame with showTitle=true
- Widget name: alphanumeric + hyphens + underscores ONLY (no spaces, parentheses, colons)`;

const LAYOUT_RULES = `Dashboard Layout Rules (6-Column Grid):
- Every row must sum to width=6 exactly -- no gaps allowed
- KPI/counter: width=2, height=3-4 (NEVER height=2 -- too cramped)
- Charts (bar/line/pie): width=3, height=5-6 (pair side-by-side)
- Full-width chart: width=6, height=5-7
- Table: width=6, height=5-8
- Text header: width=6, height=1
- Chart color/grouping dimensions: limit to 3-8 distinct values for readability
- High-cardinality dimensions (customer_id, SKU): use table widget, never chart
- Standard layout: title (y=0) → subtitle (y=1) → KPIs (y=2, 3 x w=2) → section header (y=5) → charts (y=6) → table (y=11+)`;

const MV_SQL_RULES = `Metric View SQL in Dashboards:
- MEASURE() wrapper with AS alias on ALL measures: MEASURE(\`Total Revenue\`) AS total_revenue
- NEVER prefix measure columns with a table alias (use MEASURE(col), NOT alias.col)
- Always GROUP BY ALL or explicit GROUP BY on dimension columns
- NEVER use SELECT * on a metric view (not supported)
- Validate with EXPLAIN dry-run before deploying
- Dimension columns referenced by bare name (no MEASURE wrapper)`;
